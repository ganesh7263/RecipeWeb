    <p>"Vindaloo is a popular Indian <a href="">curry dish</a> that calls
        for a meat to be marinated in a highly flavourly spicy mixture with vinegar, 
        then quickly cooked up when you're ready to eat.
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>While this dish has a long list of spices, most are quite common 
        in the average spice rack. If you find you're missing one, it's
        not a deal breaker. You still have a lovely, fragrant curry.
